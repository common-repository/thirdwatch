Stopping Frauds/Abuses in e-commerce like RTO/NDR, Chargebacks, Payment Frauds, Promo Code Abuses in real time.

== Description ==
Thirdwatch is an AI-powered platform that enables the online sellers to prevent Return-To-Origin (RTO) fraud losses. Thirdwatch's AI engine evaluates every order in real-time and provides actionable results to weed out orders likely to result in RTO.

Once integrated, the solution captures 200+ parameters from the store and leverages an ensemble of AI algorithms and graph algorithms to flag an order with high risk of RTO and enables the seller to either cancel or take corrective actions.

The processed orders acquire following two states - 
 
 Red: If the order is marked red then the sellers can either decline the order or take corrective actions like updating the address or getting the confirmation from customer on order quantity etc.
 
 Green: If the order is flagged green then the sellers can go ahead with the normal flow and ship the order

Following are the key parameters that play a critical role in screening the orders.
a) Shipping Address Profile
b) Device Fingerprint
c) IP Address Profile
d) Buyer's history
e) Buyer's navigation behaviour
f) Network effects

You can also customise the plugin at the time of integration by accessing the open source project available at  - https://github.com/thirdwatch/thirdwatch-wocommerce
